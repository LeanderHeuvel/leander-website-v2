Master Student that is looking for an opportunity within a company or organization to do a thesis in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
I am a team player and like to work with others to implement or discover new technologies. I value good cooperation and like to work with novel technologies. Among the many challenges evoking around AI, my fields of interests are sustainability, energy-transition, self-driving cars, and image processing.
